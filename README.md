Hi practice test done 


Hello!
Here is my practice challenge for you:

1. Fork this repo

2. Pull it to your local space

3. Use the command line to make a markdown file called "your_user_name.md" (see example "ababyyou.md")

4. edit the file to list:

  your favourite colour green
  
  your favourite fruit apple  
  
  your home country India

5. commit the changes to your fork on on github

6. Send me a pull request!

I will try to accept all the pull requests
